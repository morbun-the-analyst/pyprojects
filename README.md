#  Skills Lab Projects (Jupyter Notebooks)

Welcome to my **Skills Lab** repository â€” a hands-on collection of guided mini-projects and labs completed during my data analytics training. Each project showcases my ability to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize real-world data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

These labs demonstrate a broad set of practical data skills ranging from **web scraping** to **data wrangling**, **API usage**, **statistical analysis**, and more.

## Notes

These labs are part of my structured learning in data analytics. All code is annotated for clarity, and projects may evolve as I revisit and optimize them over time.
